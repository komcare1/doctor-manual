			<p>A Home-based consultation is a premium Kompletecare™ service that allows Kompletecare Members (patients) book private medical sessions in their home with a Doctor. <br><font color="red">This means that a patient would rather have a private medical session with a Doctor in the comfort of their home/office, than in the hospital.</font><br>Because of the nature of this service, it is mandatory that a Doctor have initial dialogue with any patient desiring or requesting home based consultation. This dialogue may occur through our voice/ video consultation, hospital appointment or any personal contact with such patient. For a Member(patient) to book a consultation with you, you are required to send a home consultation invite from your dashboard. While the charge for home-based consultation is at the discretion of the Doctor, please note that the minimum charge for such consultations is NGN10,000. Your patient will be notified immediately you issue the invite and will be asked to pay.<p>
			<p>
			All information regarding pending, fixed, cancelled and completed home-based consultations can be found on the CONSULTATIONS page of the Doctor panel. Simply click the "consultations" link on the navigation bar located at the left hand side of your Doctor panel.

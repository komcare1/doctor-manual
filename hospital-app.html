				<p>A Hospital appointment is a premium Kompletecare™ service that allows Kompletecare Members (patients) book premium hospital appointments with a Doctor in the Doctor's registered place of practice. This service is peculiar only to Doctors attached to a medical institution. <br><font color="red">Hospital appointments are only allowed for hospitals that have been fully registered on the Kompletecare platform. This means that the hospital's administrator has created a Kompletecare Hospital admin account that has been verified and activated.</font><br>Patients are mandated
to open hospital cards for your hospital before they can book hospital appointments with a Doctor. They may create multiple hospital cards with
a single Kompletecare Member account allowing them to book appointments in any hospital of their choice.
Once a patient books an appointment with you or the hospital administrator assigns one to you,
you will be immediately informed via email, text message and a notification shows up on your dashboard.
	Ensure you respond to all appointments assigned to you in due time. Please see the “Standard operating
policies” document on your dashboard for other important hospital appointment norms.
